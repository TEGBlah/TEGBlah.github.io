I felt really clueless at one point. Why am I even here in the first place? Nothing seemed to be under my hands.

My eyes felt saturated and burnt vigorously. The urge to splash cold water on my eyes kept increasing. I wandered hopelessly in search of water, only to find my efforts end in vain. I was exhausted and hopeless. There was not a single drop of water anywhere. "How do the plants even survive here?", I wondered.

Ah... right! I hadn’t checked inside the maze yet. It seemed to be my last hope. Standing in the eyes of the flashing and blazing light, I thought, "Should I stroll in there again?". I was in a state of dilemma. All kinds of thought crossed my mind. I fainted, the last time I had gone in there. "Was it really worth it?", I thought to myself. I had no choice now, but thinking about how it might turn up gave me shivers. I wasn’t so ecstatic on witnessing such a vision again. It didn’t have to necessarily happen again but there were chances. Time was running. My eyes were swollen. I had no time ahead to think about the consequences. I unwillingly ventured inside without any thought on it.

I tightened my legs and closed my eyes in preparation and jumped in there. The journey felt rather soothing and thankfully I had a safe and sound landing without any crashes or visions seizing the path.

As I opened my eyes, the first thing which was clearly visible was an island of flowers floating in thin air. As much as it was beautiful and fragrant, I tried to keep that far away from my already overloaded brain. I tip-toed a few meters from there only to found that I had stepped on something massive and smelly. It was a humongous cockroach!

Everything was perfectly obvious- the sames lines Quito told me reverberated in my mind, "I shall warn you the maze reads your thoughts, it understands your actions, your motive and most importantly your weaknesses".

Yes, I always felt disgusted and irked when I saw a cockroach. Here it stood just below my feet, alive! Slowly it woke up and started walking, fortunately it didn't notice me on its back at first, but my stomach started growling so loudly that the cockroach gained consciousness. It was hopping up and down. I clinged myself to its hair. This might have been a wrong move to take because exactly a moment later it scratched its body and flung me off. Falling from a great height made my back hurt tremendously.

I became aware and did not make any notice and surreptitiously tiptoed a little further until I was on safe grounds. Out of nowhere a voice spoke out- “You... you shall be murdered and slaughtered in the hands of master ring and perish". Who was master ring? What indication was it? All my thoughts started going in and out. Someone or something was certainly controlling my mind and I wasn’t able to think. My eyes were perfectly fine now, but my nose started bleeding. It kept bleeding nonstop, was this my last breath?
