## The Hope for a New Myself
### by Sansskrithi

Why can’t I be as hard as a rock<br>
With no feeling nor any reactions<br>
with all deducted emotions<br>
be just a block of void<br>
Where words are as sharp as arrows<br>
that I can’t differentiate anymore<br>
they come hitting you from nowhere and everywhere.<br> 
let me be alone<br>
with me, myself and i<br> 
Without any interruptions<br> 
because all I get from interaction<br> 
is a bit of sadness and discombobulation
<br><br>

## The Master Himself
### by Arshitha

The way every minute goes,<br>
From tic tac to toe.<br>
Every second vanishes, goof!<br>
But never reveals itself.<br>
Controlling time seems mission impossible,<br>
Why not corner off our pessimistic options?<br>
We try so hard to stop the ticking of time,<br>
Is it needed?

Once we start we never halt,<br>
Once we halt we never start,<br>
Nothing ever seems plausible.<br>
Reasoning and thinking never works,<br>
As always time keeps running.<br>
We try to stop it but we never can,<br>
Why? The question arises,<br>
But the answer never comes forward.

Think, your mind tells you.<br>
While all this happens,<br> 
Time keeps playing its game.<br>
We hold a grudge against someone,<br>
Get angry, cry, feel sad,<br>
But time continues ticking.<br>
Only a life is in our hands,<br>
But what happens?<br>
Time keeps on playing with us ceaselessly.
 
So many seconds and minutes are lost in the journey,<br>
Does that change anything?<br>
Trying and trying we lose things,<br>
Which would have landed to us smoothly,<br>
If we had taken the man himself into consideration.
<br><br>

## Set Me Free
### by Gitanjali

As time passes,<br>
memories fade,<br>
stuck in time am I,<br>
A bird with no wings to fly.<br>
Held back by unseen chains,<br>
with freedom coursing through my veins,<br>
Oh what obstacles are thee?<br>
that make me want to flee?<br>
A bird in a cage am I,<br>
with no reason to fly.
<br><br>

## Peace & Violence: Mother Nature
### by Arnav

A storm is either coming or staying<br>
But we know not, when or why.<br>
If there be a drought or flood,<br>
We know not what to do.

If a drought threatens the plains of a village,<br>
The people of the village, to the gods, they pray.<br>
Only when the barren land be touched by the ganga,<br>
The people of this flourishing village will sway

The people of the vast city that pollutes,<br>
Will know not of the wonders of nature.<br>
Only the ones who leave fake happiness,<br>
Will experience the wonders of mother nature
