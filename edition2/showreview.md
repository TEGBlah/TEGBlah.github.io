You see, but you do not observe...

This is the simplest thing that everyone should do but no one does except the one and only Sherlock Holmes.

Sherlock is a BBC show based on the stories of Arthur Conan Doyle. It starred Benedict Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes and Martin Freeman as Dr. Watson. Both the actors executed their roles to perfection. It is the story of a great mind (high functioning sociopath in his words) called Sherlock who is a consulting detective and solves several murders and mysteries .The key to his masterpieces is only being observant. It is so mesmerizing to watch all the intricate deductions that he makes which would escape the eyes of a common man. And how could I not mention about the charismatic villain named Moriarty who is as clever as Sherlock and gives him a run for his money. It has a total of 13 episodes and you will always be craving for more. I hope you guys enjoy it as much as I did.

Rating - 9/10
