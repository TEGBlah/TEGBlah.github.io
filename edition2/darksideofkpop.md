Behind all of the perfection, beauty and cheery faces, our beloved K-pop stars live a miserable life that they'll never tell you about.

**THE DARK SIDE OF K-POP...**

Every K-pop superstar strives to be perfect, but behind these flawless faces, fame and success lies a depressing truth.

From the ripe age of the teens, even as young as 13 enter training under "Slave contracts".

The young, aspiring, passionate trainees now live a life that they don't own. All of their creativity is sucked out of them.

Trainees irrespective of age are subjected to harsh and unhealthy rules. Their day is spent entirely on singing and dancing ; They barely receive 5 hours of sleep per day! Women are subjected to harsh verbal abuse while men suffer savage physical abuse if they underperform. Though fortunately the situation has improved.

Despite their frantic schedule they are forbidden from eating too much to maintain a slim physique and avoid gaining weight. Those who get too heavy are encouraged to conusume raw food, liquids or sometimes even nothing!

K-pop idols only belong in their fans' romantic fantasies. While some are supportive and positive, other go to extreme lengths to spread hate, forming biases and pairs. When it is proven to be false they react as though the stars are not entitled to their own life.

The story of a K-pop star named Sulli is heartbreaking. She attempted to break away from the cliche K-pop star image and even addressed her mental health publicly! As a result she was cyberbullied so harshly that she took her own life. She is one of the many talented souls who weren't able to handle the intense and unfair pressure.

This article is not to break the hearts of K-pop enthusiasts but a wakeup call to the entire K-pop industry. Treat your talents as humans with needs and not property, and for us to stop expecting unrealistic beauty standards.

This message is important to shared as K-pop has a massive power in inspiring millions. The voices behind it must be saved.
