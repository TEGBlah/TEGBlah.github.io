*How would a day without technology be like? No electricity, computers, TV, WiFi...*

Can you imagine 24 hours without technology? Most of us here are used to the comfort of tech, from electric fans and lights to computers and phones and can't imagine it, but people in the past, before the British Colonisation were pretty much living this kind of life. Our lifestyle has changed over the course of 200 years. Many things that were done manually, are now undertaken by robots... our lives have intertwined with tech increasingly, especially during the COVID-19 lockdown times due to online schooling. A 1 hour power-cut would make you feel frustrated.

Let's have a look at some advantages of a day without tech:
You would be able to spend time with friends, family and gain more fitness through physical activity. School work can also be completed without any distractions.

On the contrary, many important places for instance hospitals would be unable to be function, meaning the people taking treatment there would be left without any of the life saving devices namely Oxygen Support and many others. We would also lose connection with our near and dear who live abroad. Fast travel would be absent when most crucial.

As you can see, each story has 2 sides to it. Whichever side you take to this argument we must agree that technology simplifies our life however excessive dependency would be catastrophic, but at the same time we would be taking a step back by overlooking technology.
