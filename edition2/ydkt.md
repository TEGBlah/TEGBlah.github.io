4) ...Google once used a hidden feature called "foobar challenge" to hire new developers. People who search for a lot of programming-related terms will be given a notice in the bottom of their page and will be required to solve 5 hard challenges in either Java or Python. It still appears occasionally but Google doesn't hire people with it anymore.

7) ...the first published version of this website was created from scratch and was completed in less than 5 hours. The current version's total development time is just below 12 hours (Hey, we should give the ~~awesome, hard working~~ developers some credit).
