The current, fast-spreading pandemic, the COVID-19 is shaking the world, taken many lives and made our lives miserable. It has not only changed our life and made our living mechanical. We were strictly obliged to remain in quarantine for almost a whole year.

My final exams had just commenced when COVID-19 struck the entire world forcing our schools to remain shut down. The school had declared a whopping whole month of extra summer vacation which gave me the perfect chance to spend my time wisely. The two subjects, Physics and Mathematics really interested me, mostly because I really liked “conceptual subjects” which sharpened my brain quite a bit and also increased by thinking abilities. I borrowed the books for these two subjects from my senior.

I began reading the books, mainly for knowledge and also because I was bored most of the time. I also registered and participated in many online cubing competitions straight from home. All this, not only improved my knowledge but also improved my problem-solving and quick-thinking abilities. One more thing that fascinated me was, Artificial Intelligence. I really wanted to know how self-driving cars or machines functioned and how they were coded to do specific tasks. I then proceeded to learn Python, almost the most popular and the most used coding language for machine learning and artificial intelligence. Learning from one of the millions of courses online, I mastered the language sooner rather than later.

This lockdown also taught us how hard it was, to live without the fresh air of the nature and also without human interaction. We as the world together had to pass through many hoops of troubles which made our life not so enjoyable yet interesting.
