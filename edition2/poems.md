## Life
<br><br>
Life is a journey, of ups and downs.<br>
With moments to capture and mourn.<br>
It’s where you see the laughs and frowns,<br>
It is the gift of being born.<br><br>

There are times that make you smile with glee,<br>
But as well as the ones we flee.<br>
We mustn’t be sad at every bad time;<br>
Dwelling on them is not worth a dime.<br><br>

We mustn’t make life a big grand prix,<br>
We must fix our wrongs and be as happy as can be.<br>
It’s only a matter of health and time,<br>
Life isn’t a large mountain you need to climb.<br><br><br>

## Being Human
<br><br>
Ego - It seems to have taken over us.<br>
Self Esteem is needed, but not too much!<br>
Do not become as dark as dusk,<br>
Give to people and be happy as such!<br><br>

To be human, only we can do it.<br>
To show love, compassion and affection to all.<br>
To bring out what we have, and give it a split<br>
Don’t crush your heart and make it small!<br><br>

The world is unbalanced, with rich and poor,<br>
Two opposite halves, at the middle, a door.<br>
We must open it; Let the two collide<br>
Bringing balance, peace, standing side by side.<br><br>
