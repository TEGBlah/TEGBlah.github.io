### The Interview

**Q. When did you begin learning dance and music? Share with us, the motivation to pursue the same.**<br>

A. I started learning dance and music when I was around 3 years, formally when I was 6 years. I was pretty young at that point of time. It started out normally and casually, with my parents dropping me and picking me from classes.
<br><br>

**Q. Amidst all the studying and exams, what motivates you to keep on it?**<br>

A. With a lot of things going on, it is pretty hard to keep up. I think it acts as a really good break and a change. When you grow older you will understand the value of all these things, When passion starts to become a part of you. As a kid it just felt like a chore to go to class. As time passed it became a part of me. I just do it because I am passionate about it. It is mostly something that progresses through age. When I was young my mother motivated me immensely to continue it.
<br><br>

**Q. When was your first ever solo performance and at what age was it held?**<br>

A. My first ever performance was when I was 4 years old but I only started to learn formally when I was 6 years old. My arangetram took place when I was eleven in 2013.
<br><br>

**Q. Did you find it hard to cope up with your studies with dance and music, during your 12th board exams?**<br>

A. Yes, it was pretty hard to cope up with dance and music during 12th board exams. I would try my very best to practice every now and then when I found time, but keeping the practises regular was challenging.
<br><br>

**Q. What is one life lesson that dance and music has taught you?**<br>

A. Both dance and music taught me how we must enjoy whatever we do, because we want to do it and are passionate about it. It teaches other values, values of consistency as you simply canâ€™t dance well just by dancing once in a month or sing well just by practising whenever you get time, at your own comfort. You learn that consistency is  at the core of developing these skills. It also helps in understanding other values that you see along your school life that is hard work and dedication.
<br><br>

**Q. What do you consider as your biggest accomplishment till date in both the fields?**<br>

A. I do have a couple of achievements. As a dancer I have been a recipient of the ccrt scholarship from the government of India since 2013. I have done quite a lot of duet and solo performances in dance. Also, I have performed numerous duet performances with my sister in music. At the end of the day, I love to dance and sing and don't care too much about the achievements.
