title: Indian Cricket in 1983 - A Movie Review

1983 was an extremely significant year for the Indian cricket team, as they had won the world cup for the first time in their existence. 

The movie 83 is about the Indian cricket team’s journey to victory. The Indian team used to be one of the worst cricket teams ever to have existed. They had little to no respect as they had won only one match since then, which was against East Africa which went through almost the same struggles. 

On the other hand, there was the West Indies cricket team, who were known to "not lose a match". They were armed with deadly bowlers and the best batsman at the time, Vivian Richards. 83 highlights this achievement in the form of an entertaining movie. 

This movie also shows how the Indian team’s performance was doubted and the mentality of many who had thought that this would be the last time they would ever participate in a World Cup. Ranveer Singh’s roleplay as Kapil Dev was stupendous and flabbergasting. 

The movie also included a few cameos of Kapil Dev and M Amarnath. 83, was more of a documentary rather than a movie. Nonetheless, I indulged in watching it. Overall, 83 would be something that I would recommend you to watch and I hope you would enjoy it.
