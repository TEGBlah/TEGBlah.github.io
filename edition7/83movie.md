1983 was an extremely significant year for the Indian cricket team, it was the first time they won the world cup. The movie 83 is about the Indian cricket team’s journey to victory. 83 is unlike many other Indian movies on sports, there isn’t much added drama like we see in other movies of the genre. The story is unmodified. 

At its premise, the Indian team is one of the worst cricket teams ever, they have little respect and they had only won one match so far against East Africa which is not even a country. On the other hand, there is the West Indies cricket team, who had not lost a single match so far, they were armed with deadly bowlers and the best batsman at the time, Vivian Richards. The movie highlights this achievement in the form of an entertaining movie. Ranveer Singh’s acting as Kapil Dev was outstanding and the movie even had a few cameos of Kapil Dev and M Amarnath. 

The movie shows how the Indian team’s performance was doubted and many thought this was the last time they would ever play in a world cup. The movie was more of a documentary rather than a movie, but nonetheless, I enjoyed watching it. Overall, 83 was a movie that I would watch again and it is a movie I would recommend to other people
