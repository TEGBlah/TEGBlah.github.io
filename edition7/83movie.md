1983 was an extremely significant year for the Indian cricket team as it was the first time they had won The Cricket World Cup. The movie 83 follows the Indian cricket team’s journey to victory. The movie is unlike several others of the same kind and there isn’t much added drama we see in other movies of the genre and the story is completely unmodified. 

So the premise: The Indian team is one of the worst cricket teams in existence, they have little respect and they had only won one match so far against East Africa which isn't even a country. On the other hand, there is the West Indies cricket team, who had not lost a single match so far. They were armed with deadly bowlers and the best batsman at the time, Vivian Richards. Even though the Indian team’s performance was doubted and many speculated this was the last time they would ever play in a world cup, India emerged valiant, and 83 highlights this humongous achievement in an entertaining manner. 

Ranveer Singh’s acting as Kapil Dev was astounding and there were even a few cameos of Kapil Dev and M Amarnath. 83 however was a bit like a documentary rather than a movie, but nonetheless, I enjoyed it watching it. Overall, 83 was a movie that I would watch again and it is a movie I would recommend to other people.
