## Science or Philosophy?
### by Arnav

Science is in a pursuit to find the workings of the universe.<br>
While philosophy on the other hand, wonders what is real.<br>
To see which one is true, in deep thought I immerse.<br>
But first, I want to know. What do other people feel?

Some say we are the eyes of a stellar space-being.<br>
Some say we are but an ant, compared to the vast above.<br>
Scientists see a big opportunity for seizing.<br>
Philosophers think thoughts that are way overstuffed.

This argument could last from summer to fall.<br>
Thinking like this makes everyone’s mind go damp.<br>
I like to think that there are three words above all.<br>
Cogito, ergo, sum. I think, therefore, I am.

## The Festivals of India
### by Arnav

India is filled with many, many festivals.<br>
They have sweets, snacks and lots and lots of fun!<br> 
For every festival here, there is something to enjoy,<br> 
And the amount of angry faces is none! 

Diwali is known as the festival of light<br>
The day Krishna slayed Kamsa, with might!<br>
Yummy Gulab Jamuns are adored on that day<br>
And to burst many crackers that day, we pray! 

On the day of Eid, we fill our stomachs to our please.<br> 
Just take a look at this big, grand feast!<br>
Sindhi Biryani, Tangine and many dishes alike.<br> 
There is no proper exercise, you’ll need to take a hike! 

When we wake up on Christmas day,<br>
We run to the tree, nobody in our way!<br> 
We open our presents and devour plum cake, nearly,<br> 
No wonder we wake up our parents so early!<br><br>

## Diamond Tears
### By Tejasmira

The line between ecstacy and despair,<br>
When your heart is broken<br>
Too much to repair.<br>
Or when your heart speeds up<br>
And you're filled with cheer,<br>
One thing common<br>
Is a tear.

The day you found a four-leaf clover,<br>
Or the day you failed,<br>
Making a daring maneuver<br>
And you're hurt, in fear.<br>
You touch your cheek<br>
And feel a tear.

The day you lost the one;<br>
The one who kept you going,<br>
The one who made sure<br>
That life wouldn't be boring.<br>
You can't smile, you forget how to.<br>
You want to shed a tear,<br>
But your eyes are dry.

They say tears can hint one's sorrow,<br>
But save them for tomorrow.<br>
For your tears are like diamonds;<br>
You have to protect and hide them.<br><br>

## Smile
### by Tejasmira

A beautiful smile,<br>
From ear to ear<br>
Takes away<br>
All of ones fears.<br>
The impression of happiness<br>
Gives one reassurance.

A forced smile,<br>
From ear to ear<br>
Good at hiding<br>
One's own fear.<br>
The broken heart,<br>
With stitches of pretence.<br>
To some people, it never makes sense.

An evil smile<br>
From ear to ear<br>
Which instantly unlocks<br>
All of one's fears.<br>
Though the heart seems to be steel<br>
Underneath, is a wound too deep to heal.

From this as you may see,<br>
A smile can suit any emotion you can be.<br>
So cherish it all, show some gratitude.<br>
With a never-fading smile,<br>
And a cheerful attitude.<br>
