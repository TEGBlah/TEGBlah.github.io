## Science or Philosophy?
### by Arnav

Science is in a pursuit to find the workings of the universe.<br>
While philosophy on the other hand, wonders what is real.<br>
To see which one is true, in deep thought I immerse.<br>
But first, I want to know. What do other people feel?

Some say we are the eyes of a stellar space-being.<br>
Some say we are but an ant, compared to the vast above.<br>
Scientists see a big opportunity for seizing.<br>
Philosophers think thoughts that are way overstuffed.

This argument could last from summer to fall.<br>
Thinking like this makes everyoneâ€™s mind go damp.<br>
I like to think that there are three words above all.<br>
Cogito, ergo, sum. I think, therefore, I am.

## The creek down the hill
### by Arnav

Every time I go out for a walk,<br>
I see the little creek,<br>
Running down the hill,<br>
Flowing into the park.

It gushes past the plants,<br>
Swerves around the pebbles<br>
And when the giant rock set foot on the hill,<br>
The creek moved around, being ever so gentle.

It seems to be relentless,<br>
Flowing around every obstacle.<br>
People think its just water,<br>
But I think its a spectacle.

Every time I go out for a walk,<br>
Every time I see a resting croc,<br>
I see the little creek,<br>
Running down the hill,<br>
Flowing into the park.
