Chapter 1: The Calling

A desolate place in the middle of nowhere, untouched by civilization and the tyranny of the people outside of its boundaries was the place where the secrets started soon enveloped by mistrust. The wars marked the beginning of a fall that would throw all balance into disarray. The quiet whispers of the “monsters” filled my ears making it hard to breathe. I woke up with a start breathing heavily, feeling fairly frightened as I recollected the events in the dream. It started off as nothing, a vast oblivion where no light or sound seemed to escape. I opened my mouth to shout as loudly as I could but my muscles seemed to be glued together. I was a mere spectator.

 Suddenly the whole scene changed into that of a war..it was fierce, many wounded, some dead all happening in front of my very eyes. I felt the hatred as the swords clashed against each other then I felt sorrow from those who had to fight their own. Overwhelming feelings entrapped me as I stood there and watched the violence take place. Soon the edges of my vision seemed to blur and all the battle cries suddenly seemed distant. That's when the whispers started trying to plant in my head ideas of hatred. I refused to let them in, not now. Fighting against my own mind, I hoped with all my heart that this nightmare would end and then it did. My own will power had won against it this time but something deep in my gut told me this wouldn’t be my first and last encounter with this dream that felt too much like reality. 

The rest of my day went as normal with no sign of anything suspicious but I couldn’t shake the anxious feeling..As I was about to walk outside my tiny yet cozy cottage I ran straight into brother who then greeted me with a small hug then proceeded to knock several things down..”Tim! You need to cut your hair my clumsy little brother” I teased him as he entered. My brother and I lived on the far edge of a small town filled to the brim with various traders, merchants and craftsmen. The town was pretty lively but loud and chaotic at the same time. 

My brother, Tim, was just an infant when my parents and I found him on the bank of a river all alone in a basket. We waited while playing with the young Timothy for almost 4 hours and no one seemed to show up for him so he’s been stuck with me since then. “Did you see the new books they added in the library Des? I heard Tim ask me but somehow I couldn’t bring myself to answer that question. I was too busy debating on whether or not I should tell him about the dreams. “Helllooooo Earth to Destinyyy!!” shouted Tim straight into my ears making me jump. Right as I opened my mouth to answer his question and talk to him about my strange dreams. We heard a loud siren..a siren I thought we would never hear after all these years.
