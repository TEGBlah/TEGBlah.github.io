 The year 1914 has come. Technology, inventions, culture and fashion have come to a new height. Though all this was happening, everyone knew that there was a war coming up. France wanted parts of Germany that Germany took over and the Ottoman Empire and Austria Hungary invaded very small nations. The Russians did help a few Balkan states like Serbia, Albania and Montenegro to gain independence from the Austro-Hungarian empire which obviously made Austria-Hungary very angry. The country of present day Bosnia and Herzegovina which was part of the Austro-Hungarian empire back in 1914 was very hated by the Bosnians.

 The Austro-Hungarian duke, Franz Ferdinand, decided to pay a visit to the current day capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Sarajevo. Since everyone in current day Bosnia and Herzegovina hated the duke and his empire, assassination attempts did happen. But 1 guy in Sarajevo did get a proper shot at the Duke of Austria-Hungary, Franz Ferdinand, and killed him. This again annoyed Austria-Hungary and thought that Serbia was part of a lot of the planning. Austria Hungary went to their allies Germany and told them that they were going to declare war on Serbia. Germany agreed and the 2 allied nations declared war on Serbia. Serbia was allied with Russia at that time, involving the Russians into the war and the Russians were allied with the French who were involved in the war and the French were involved in an alliance with the UK but the UK only partially joined the war at this time, supplying France, Russia and Serbia with supplies.

 The Germans thought that Russia was so big, that they would take a while to be fully ready. So German officials thought they could invade France at lightning speed and move all troops from France to Russia and invade Russia. Only problem was, France had several forts on the German/French border. Germany didn't have time to fight them so they went around France, where Belgium was. So Germany declared war on Belgium. Belgium was neutral in the war but Germany had to send 17,000 troops through Belgium.

 Germany thought Belgium wouldn't fight but they were wrong, they fought and the Belgians were pretty good. What's worse was that the British finally involved themselves in the war. The British didn't have any of Germany annexing neutral countries, so Britain declared war on Germany and joined the allies. The president of the United States wanted peace between everyone, the allies and Germany and the Austro-Hungarian empire.

 Russia finally got ready, while Germany was still fighting the UK and Belgium in Belgium. Germany told Austria-Hungary to take care of Russia. They did. But only for a little bit. Austria-Hungary also gets attacked from the south, Serbia. Serbia repelled every single invasion attack from Austria-Hungary. Germany finally got the march from Belgium and into France. The Germans had visualized the French capital, Paris. Germany was doing well in both the west and the east. The Chief of Staff of France had to do something. He told his army to not retreat and fight them. This was the battle of Marne. Germany was taking care of France in the east of Paris and the British troops in the west. A gap opened up between them and French troops came through the gap and went from behind to attack the Germans. This made the Germans retreat and go back all the way into Belgium......

 To be continuedâ€¦.
