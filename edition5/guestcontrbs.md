Let us assume that you are in a confusing situation. Your parents want you to do something creative like writing articles or blogs, but you are just a simpleminded person who plays Minecraft everyday and has horrible spelling. You desire to write a blog to astonish your friends and parents. You think for hours but can’t find any good topic to compose with. You go to google and search “Very interesting to articles to write ”. You go to every possible website you see on your screen and see the same answer


You then realize where English teachers get their topic from for the final tests to write on
(You make note of these topics so you can score well on the next exam)
Then you make a deliverance that you should just probably give up...but then

Instantaneously realising that you made a new topic you try to make a blog about it
You search the topic on google and see if anyone wrote about it, and you see: 




You click on the topmost link and it takes you to a page with a 1000 lines full of gibber gabber
You are perplexing so hard not to press ctrl+c and paste it on word.
Then you finally give up and go back to Discord and chatting with your friends .
8 days go by and you forget about this “making an article” drama.
You finally come up with an idea.

“omg articles are so hard to make, please save me aaaaaaaaaaaaaah”

you think of a more subtle and suitable title. 

“Writing articles/blog”
You go on to write the article and just put whatever comes to your mind.
Then you realize that you have no sense of complicated words and you do a quick google search,

“complex alternative words for <insert word here>”

Then you copy paste the words directly into the word document.
You finally finish the article and you are ready to send it to your friend so he can post it on the school website.
when doubtful thoughts cross your mind...

“should I do this?”
“should I really do this?”
“what if they reject me?”
“what if they say they don’t like my article?”
“what if they say my article is not an article?”
“all my hard work will be put to waste.”

You stare at the screen waiting…
