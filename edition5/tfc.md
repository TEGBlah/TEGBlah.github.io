We started trembling with horror when we saw that awful sight but I decided it was logical to call the police immediately. I called and lodged a complaint. We waited for the police to arrive and after a quick set of questions, they wanted the cook, the maid and the nurse to come in for investigation. After I had called both of them, I promptly called my grandma. She was in great shock after hearing this and came right away after closing her bakery for the day. Even though my grandma held a grudge against my mother she was weeping, sorrow and guilt evident in her face. 
At a distance I could see the cook, maid and the nurse rushing into the house. The police, after interrogating everyone including me and seeing the foreign SIC reports had gathered some evidence that would help us. They are as follows:

1)The mother was killed by a poison that had caused a heart attack and the poison was in an eclair (a French pastry) which was supposedly given to her by her murderer.
2)The nurse, cook and maid claimed that they had last seen the mother the previous day and had taken the day off to spend time with their family for thanksgiving.
3)The grandma claims to have seen the mother the previous day too and had come there just to have a small chat with the mother.
4) Main suspects: The cook and the grandma both skilled at cooking and baking and could have poisened the eclair 
5)There was no force entry so whoever did this was a person she knew and trusted dearly.

While the interrogation continued I spotted something that made my heart crumble with betrayal and shock. I saw a box of French pastries in my brother’s bag while searching for the milk bottle for my niece. I ran towards my brother and asked confronted him. He said that he had bought it in a shop in California and had bought it for my mother since she loves French pastries. It wasn’t exactly convincing. So, I had created my own suspect list and it is as follows.

Cook- An easy suspect, there's a good chance that she had made the eclairs and poisoned them but her motive was unclear. She was always asking for a raise, maybe that could have been the motive  but I’m not so sure. Family says she was there with them the whole time but they could be lying.

Grandma- She owns a bakery, hence excelled at making French pastries. She had always held a grudge on my mother but I’m not sure if she would go to this extent, though she could have. Has no alibi.

Brother- Had come half an hour before I did so had plenty of time to go and give my mother the pastry. Maybe he lied about not having a key...my sister-in-law claims that she was feeding the baby and had gone to the neighbor's house and had come back just a minute before I did. Has no alibi and no motive.
