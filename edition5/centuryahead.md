I thought Quito was sarcastic, but sometimes he shows unrecognizable expressions. The weather was fine; it wasn't cloudy or sunny, even the fact that we were deep inside the earth didn’t make a difference. Except, here people preferred to fly using mechanical wings rather than to walk(who would seriously fly, when you can walk). There were so many things around here that were divergent and peculiar. 
“Samina clothe jee ,“ a woman shouted. Again, I understood nothing. This had been a problem since I had arrived. I preferred to call it  “puzzled talk” as I didn’t understand it exactly the way they did. Somehow, I figured out that the woman wasn’t calling out to me, as she started approaching a girl who was in front of me. (I never had noticed a person standing in front of me, since I had been purely focused on what the lady was muttering in Latin).
Quito was sitting on a tree and cherishing some apples. I shouted “Hi!” Quito to hear. He immediately turned his neck, took his binoculars and looked somewhere. Then, he started approaching me and said “Hi, Saud lay”.  I supposed that it was a good morning and nodded back. 
Then, I quickly jumped off and started asking him questions (I had no patience at all). “So, umm…who are those two people?” I questioned sternly. “Oh them! They are like the walls of this land...They keep this place hidden to restore its beauty. They are known as the Zee twins,” he said with evident enthusiasm.
“They are the oldest beings almost 1,00,000 years old, with a lot of experience, knowledge and most of all they see the past sometimes of unique people mostly not from our world, during particular periods. This year is very exquisite and is the shortest year in the past 5,000 years. A year which has always been feared, but it always tasks everyone with adventures, exploration and important fields.”
 “Fields?” I asked.
“It is an aspect portrayed in here,” said Quito.
“Oh! Also, how are they twins? They look like they’re 100 years apart,” I asked curiously.
“They change their age according to their mood. So, it might look as though they aren’t twins but they are,” assured Quito.
 Confusion filled me and out of frustration I let out a nearly silent grunt, I closed my eyes tightly and started walking. You would probably think that walking with closed eyes was dangerous but that is not how it worked here. Most people didn’t walk, others who did had the ability to detect sound waves from a distance. So, it was not a problem. This place was the safest but the strangest place on Earth... you wouldn’t want to wander in here. The place had two tunnels one towards the Northeast direction and the other towards the Northwest direction which lead to the Sun's core and Kepler 452B's surface respectively. Fascinating right?
“I am feeling dizzy...What time is it now? “ I asked Quito . His face turned as pale as a ghost when I asked him that.
“Oh! Didn’t I tell you about how you have to use the Zeepdial?” Quito asked with a weird accent. 
“Zeep- dia….—“I was trying to make sense of the word but he stopped me and started to talk.
 “Do not interrupt while I speak..You might be aware we don’t really have the moon’s or the sun’s light to reflect us and so it is difficult to  use the Sundial, through which our ancestors predicted different calamities and of course, time. You're Probably wondering why we don’t rely on technology, yes? When we had to take possession of the underworld the Zee twins had anticipated problems towards many things mankind would relieve during that period . Technology was one the most threatening factors of all of them so they decided to leave that behind. Let me take you to the Zeepdial chamber come along”.
We kept walking for a long while until.. I lost all my energy and started panting. 
“Are you feeling tired already? It hasn’t even been 5 min since we started walking.” asked Quito with a sardonic smile.
 “5 minutes!? It feels like I have been walking for hours! Can we please take a break please?” I pleaded.
 “Wait a second... Do not move!” Ordered Quito with a concerned look on his face
