I thought Quito was sarcastic, but sometimes he held unrecognisable expressions.  The weather was fine; wasn’t cloudy neither sunny, even the fact of it being deep inside the earth didn’t make a difference. Except, here people preferred to fly using mechanical wings rather than to walk(who would seriously fly, when you can walk). There were so many things around here that were divergent and peculiar.

“Samina clothe jee ,“ a woman shouted. Again, I understood nothing. This had been a problem from the time I had arrived. I preferred to call it the “ puzzled talk” as I didn’t interpret it exactly the way they did. Somehow , I figured out  that the women wasn’t calling me , as she started approaching a girl who was in front of me. (I never had noticed a person standing in front, as I was purely focused on what the lady was muttering in Latin) .Quito was sitting on a tree and cherishing some Apples.

“Hi” I shouted for Quito to hear. He immediately turned his neck and took his binoculars and looked somewhere. Then, he started approaching me.

“ Hi, Saud lay, “ he said. I supposed that was a good morning and nodded my head. I instantly jumped off and started asking him questions (I had no patience indeed ).

“So, umm…who are those two people”? I questioned sternly.

“Oh them! They are like the walls of this land who keep this place hidden and restore its beauty they are known as the  Zee twins,” he said all this with enthusiasm.

“They are the oldest being 1,00,000 years old, with a lot of experience, knowledge and most of all they see the past sometimes of unique people mostly not from our world, during particular periods. This year is very exquisite and is the shortest year in the past 5,000 years. A year which is always feared, but it always tasks everyone with adventures, exploration and most important fields.”

“Fields?” I asked

“It is an aspect portraited here,” Quito said
“Oh! Also, how are they twins they look like they have a gap of 100 years between each other,” I asked curiously.
 
“ They change their age according to their mood. So, it might look as though they aren’t twins but they are,” assured Quito.

Confusion, confusion and confusion it was filled in every inch and corner here “aaa”.

Filled with frustration , I tightly closed my eyes and started walking. You would probably think that walking with closed eyes was dangerous but that is not how it worked here. Most people didn’t walk ,others who did -they had the capability to detect sound waves from a distance itself .So , it was not the problem. Except it was the safest but the most Strangest place on earth you wouldn’t want to wander in here. This place  had  two tunnels one in the northeast and the other in the northwest which respectively lead  to the Sun's core and Kepler 452B's Surface. That is pretty fascinating ,right?

“ I am feeling dizzy ,what time is it know? “ I asked Quito . His face turned red when I asked him that .

“Oh! Didn’t I tell you about how you have to use the Zeepdial ? “Quito asked with an unrecognisable accent.

“Zeep- dia….—“I was trying to interpret it in a way where it might make sense but he paused me and started to talk.

“ Do not interrupt while I speak. As you might be aware we  don’t really have the  moon’s  or  the sun’s light to reflect us and so it is difficult to calculate using the Sundial through which our ancestors predicated different calamities as well as the time.You would probably be wondering why we don’t rely on technology right? When we had to take possession of the underworld the Zee twins had anticipated   problems towards many things mankind relied during that period  . Technology was one the most   threatening factors of all of them so they decided  to leave that behind. Let me you take you to the Zeepdial chamber come along .”
We kept seamlessly walking until I had lost all my energy and started gasping.
“ Are you feeling tired already? It hasn’t even been 5 min  since we started.” asked Quito with a sardonic smile.

“5min ? It feels as though I have been walking for hours and hours .Can’ t we take a break?”I asked

“Wait a second. Do not move !”Ordered Quito with an absolutely stern look.
