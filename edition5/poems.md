## Addiction
### by Arnav


Believe me, it took this script long to write<br>
I needed a lot of courage and might<br>
One more time is what we always say<br>
But later, for it to never happen again, we pray.

It happened to me, a day or two ago.<br>
It was fine at first, until I never let go.<br>
No matter how hard I pulled on myself<br>
‘Twas that one game that never left my shelf

Took a lot of time to let my grip go soft<br>
That one game went from my shelf to the loft<br>
Finally! Free from the devil’s land<br>
Whoever else is there, take my hand

## Dream
### by Arshitha

Why do we dream? What is a dream?<br>
Full of thoughts here and there,<br>
Thinking upon if it really exists!<br>
 From a night full of peace ,<br>
Till a day upon our hopes.<br>
Why does it happen?<br>
Is it an Illusion or what is it?<br>
Can we predict it happenings ?<br>
We day dream as well as night dream ,<br>
Both are basically the same but what potential do they put forward?<br>
Why do we dream? What is a dream?

## Limericks
### by Arshitha

Tit was a red mat,<br>
But, he couldn’t  hide a cat,<br>
He would fall on his own legs,<br>
And the cat would beg,<br>
Don’t cover! Don’t cover that!


A man was brave,<br>
He would always engrave.<br>
Once he ran out of ink,<br>
And decided to think,<br>
Finally,he was saved!
