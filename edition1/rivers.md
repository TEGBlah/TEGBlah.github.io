For millenia rivers have been reverred as the lifeline of civilization.

We depend on rivers for drinking, irrigation, power and transport and for our other daily activities.

However human exploitation of recources with utter disregard of fragile ecosystems is leading to unprecedented damage to our rivers.

The thought of not having water for our future generations is horrifying. This atrocity must be stopped.

We as a world should come together.

The first step is bringing awareness ragarding water recources to humanity at large.
There are several organisations that are commited to creating this awareness and are ready to lead the way.

If left unchecked tomorrow's world will be dominated by wars as nations fight for control over diminishing water recources.

WE MUST NOT TAKE THE WATER WE RECEIVE FOR GRANTED AND SHOULD PRESERVE IT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.
