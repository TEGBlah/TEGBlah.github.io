                  In a small town, tucked into the deep woods at the foothills of the Himalayas, there lived a fearless boy of 11 - Rahul.
                  <br><br>
                  Within the outskirts of the town there was a road that was intended for long distance travel, but used by none. 
                  <br><br>
                  A Part of its wall had been broken down with debris scattered all over and moss enveloping the wall. This gave way to a mysterious jungle containing cartoonishly green flora. The jungle was so unrealistically packed with trees that the townsmen believed it hid something supernatural behind it ; they never dared venture near it.
                  <br><br>
                  Rahul who was new to the town decided to hike through this jungle, to debunk the supposedly irrational fear of the townsmen.
                  <br><br>
                  He started walking, trying to avoid the debris of the dark road, and under his breath he made it to the jungle.
                  <br><br>
                  As he stumbled over the clutter of the moss, dead leaves and crippled branches, he found a boy around the age of seven. With his dim headlight he could make out that he was sitting under a grey, leafless and mostly lifeless tree on the crumpled dry leaves.
                  <br><br>
                  The boy appeared to be sobbing, with his palms hiding his face. Rahul was shocked... But fearlessly approached the boy and questioned him.
                  <br><br>
                  "What are you doing here? It is quite late and there are wild animals on the prowl... Do get up. Stop crying..." he asked anxiously repeatedly.
                  <br><br>
                  The boy paid no attention to Rahul. Vexed, Rahul aggressively strode away. After he had taken a few steps he heard the crunching of leaves and footsteps.
                  <br><br>
                  "Thank you... Now just tell me-", Rahul stood aghast. The boy had taken his hands off his face.
                  <br><br>
                  He had no facial features. Completely blank. Lacking eyes, eyebrows, nose, mouth, or ears. He just stood there, his face blank like a white sheet of paper.
                  <br><br>
                  He steadily started advancing towards Rahul. His screaming filled the air and Rahul knew fear for the first time in his life.
                  <br><br>
                  Rahul ran like the wind, round the bend till he came to the gates of the Sharma's mansion. The watchman of the mansion was a good friend of Rahul's.
                  <br><br>
                  Puffing and panting, his cheeks the colour of Shimla apples, he waited for the gates to be opened.
                  <br><br>
                  The watchman Ramdas enquired why he was out at this time of the night.
                  <br><br>
                  Rahul narrated the entire incident. Ramdas gasped. "What do you mean he had no face?"
                  "I'm telling you truly, he didn't have a face...No eyes, ears... Nothing!"
                  <br><br>
                  There was a tiny lamp, dangling near Ramdas' leg, flickering with the wind. Rahul was in a disturbed state. Ramdas suddenly spoke.
                  <br><br>
                  "You mean no face... Like this?", he asked and put the lamp nearer.
                  <br><br>
                  He had no face. It was blank.
                  <br>
                  And the wind blew the lamp off.
