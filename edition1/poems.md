## Patriotism

We all respect our country, don’t we?<br>
In supporting and serving it, we find glee!<br>
Now the world is rid with greed,<br>
In our lovely garden, a spreading weed!
<br><br>

We have all completely changed,<br>
We aren't what we used to be.<br>
Cash-thirsty misers, not everything’s free!<br>
Sharing is something that we all now flee
<br><br>

We must save the world, one way or another,<br>
We must find a way to restore glory.<br>
We must respect our country, serve it and sweat,<br>
Working together is our best option only!
<br><br><br>


## The Long Wishlist

I have a long wishlist,<br>
Full of things I like to do!<br>
To be a gamer or a cyclist,<br>
What about you?
<br><br>
To trek to the top of Everest,<br>
Or to dive deep into the Mariana<br>
No way that I will rest,<br>
Till I row down the Parana!
<br><br>
To be a poet or a writer?<br>
I don’t know where to start!<br>
I bet I could be a carpenter,<br>
To give life to a big blue chart!
