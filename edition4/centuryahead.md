<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Unexpected Meeting</h2>

When I woke up my body was tired. The temperature in the surroundings was very cold and I was shivering. My hand had turned white and my legs didn’t even move as though all the nerves in my legs had turned lifeless.  

“How in the world! “I muttered to myself.  

I heard footsteps approaching me. The boy in front of me had blue eyes, grey hair (but he didn’t quite look like he was old), he was tall and was most probably a teenager.  

“Salve,” he said. “Quid agis”  

Had this man gone mad? I was sure that he was addressing me but I didn’t understand a thing.  

“What?” I asked  

Then, he twisted his neck (in a 180 degree’s angle. It was scary; At least I had never seen anyone do that). It looked as if he was changing trying to change his voice.  

“Hi,” he said. “How are you doing?“  

“Hello,” I said suspiciously. “Where am I? Who are you and how did you do that? Which language were you speaking in?  

“Ok! Ok! Wait. I will give you all your answers “, he said.  

“I am Quito. You are in Zeelant, normally people don’t pop up here like the last person who came here was when I was 800 years that was a century before. I should tell everyone to guard the Entrances. We don’t want people coming and arriving again, do we? However, you can stay here as long you wish just be sure to see the path you travel. All the people here speak Latin here so I thought you too speak and don’t think too much about the exercise I did, it is a daily routine found useful for people living here. Oh! Forgot to ask what’s your name?”  

I stood amazed at all the things he said. First of all, I was so curious in getting to know how he had lived for 900 years!  

“I am Arsh” I answered.  

For a second, he stood motionless as if I had broken his house. He took a stern glance at me and looked surprised.  

“The day has come.” Quito sighed. “Nice to meet you Arsh.”  

What did he mean by that? Why did I land in an unknown place? Why did I come down here? Something was linking these places I guessed. I had to find my older self who had brought me here first. I had so many questions with no answers.
