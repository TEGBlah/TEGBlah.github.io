People usually give a quick response when asked who the inventor of the light bulb was. The name Thomas Edison is a household name. However, many might be at odds when asked of the inventor of ac (alternating current), namely Nikolas tesla. The Invention of AC was an important one. This is mainly because its voltage can be stepped up and down, thereby preventing the loss of power during transmission. Edison’s inventions were useless without power supply, and DC (direct current) although providing adequate amounts of current, was costly due to the power loss during transmission. Tesla was a genius far ahead of his times, and his genius was greater than Edison’s, although his wasn’t unremarkable either .Edison’s light bulb was measly compared to some of tesla’s inventions such as the tesla coil .So why isn’t Nicholas tesla’s name familiarised , just like Edison’s?  

The answer may lie in the extent of their respective marketing genius. Although AC current was significantly more efficient, Edison was more adept at marketing his inventions. During the Current wars, some of Edison’s supporters even went as far as electrocuting animals to show ac current to be unsafe, although dc current would have had the same effect. Edison was more practical and commercially oriented.  

On the contrary, Tesla didn’t have a flare for marketing. He failed to capitalize on his inventions, an example being the Wardenclyffe Tower the .His incompetence in marketing led him to finally die penniless
