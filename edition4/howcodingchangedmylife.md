title: How Coding Changed My Life

A lot has changed in the world, mainly the modernization and the digitalization of things. Digitalization is the capability of making things easier by automating it in a virtual or an electronic device. Coding is the most interesting and intuitive of them all. You can automate almost any task by writing a script or a code.  

Coding is a fun and interesting habit that I believe people should start to develop as the world turns into a futuristic space. Many people visualize coding as typing random letters into the keyboard but it has a lot more meaning than that. Let me take you through my coding journey and what I personally think about it.  

I first heard the term “coding”, in the middle of 2020 and got really interested by it. My journey of coding started with a deep research of it which took several hours. But, amongst all the research, the one term that intrigued me was “programming languages”. Were they just normal languages like English?  

After learning more about them, I came to know that they were the language used for writing the script or the code. The highest rated and the most beginner-friendly programming language was Python. I then proceeded learning it by watching a famous tutorial on YouTube. It was a bit difficult at the beginning but as I started dedicating more time and interest into it, it became much easier. I finished learning the “basics” of the language in about a week.  

Soon after learning, I was able to code the language far more efficiently. One of the valuable lessons that I learnt from coding was, “the more interest and time you dedicate into something, the easier it will be to master it”.  

I was able to automate almost everything, starting from calculations to virtual AI based bots that replied with a unique answer for every question asked. I learnt many more programming languages built for many different purposes like HTML, CSS and JavaScript for web-development; JavaScript for console-based applications; Java for applications and C++ for building desktop applications.  

You can do Programming as a specialization or just as a hobby. Either way, Programming or Coding is a great way to spend your time and improve your knowledge if you are bored whilst also imparting a great amount of knowledge and improving your learning and thinking abilities. It is a sure preparation for the future and the world of digitalization.
