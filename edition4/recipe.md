**Preparation:**  

Soak tamarind in 1/4th of a cup of water.  
Heat one tsp of oil and fry chana dal and urad dal until light and golden.  
Add red chillies to the dal when golden. Fry until the chillies turn crisp and the dal turns deep golden. Do not over fry the chillies as the pickle may taste bitter later on.  
Remove them from the pan and add them to a plate to cool.  
Pour a little bit more oil and add onions and ginger. Separate layers of cuboid onions as yields a great Aromatic chutney. Also you will need to slice the ginger and not chop as this results in a bitter taste.  
Keep frying and stirring till the onions turn pinkish to golden. Do not brown the ginger. Turn off the stove and cool these.

Add this mixture to the blender.  
Add in salt and jaggery.
