The day started well…… it was a pleasant morning in the month of November. I was travelling to my mum’s place for Thanksgiving. Knowing a feast was awaiting I wanted to reach there eagerly unbeknown what was afoot. I got off the plane at The Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport and took a car to my parent’s house in the Puerto Rico.  

Before I continue any further let me tell a little bit about my family - My mum who lived in a beach house in Puerto Rico and was so loving and caring towards our family, a brother who is the smartest person I have met, my sister-in-law who is basically my own sister and their cute little daughter who was less than a year old and had caught our heart with her cuteness. And finally the pillar and the oldest member of my family, my paternal grandmother who is 98 years old who live a few streets away my parent’s house. And of course, how can I forget our dog which my mom had and were always a part of my family.  

So back to the story, I was travelling in car to reach my mum's place. Though the journey from the airport to the house was a long one it was also salubrious journey with palm trees at our eyesight and beautiful shores and blue water at a distance.  

I was travelling from Nevada while my brother’s family was coming from California. We had planned to meet at our parents place the day before thanksgiving that was 24th November. Both of our planes were supposed to arrive at 3 pm but my plane got delayed due to technical issues. Hence, they had reached the house before me.  

After a dreadfully tedious journey I was really happy to finally be home. I got of the car, only to see that my brother’s family was waiting in the front lawn. I walked towards them to ask why they were waiting there. They answered, “The door is locked outside and we she has gone out to get groceries. And I think even our cook, nurse and the maid have taken the day off because of thanksgiving. Would you happen to have a pair of spare keys?” “Sure I have a pair, but instead of waiting you could have asked the neighbours as they always have one”, I replied courteously.  

I opened the door and to my awful surprise I found my mom lying flat on the floor. All of us rushed down to the hall, but unfortunately, we were too late. She was gone before we got there.
