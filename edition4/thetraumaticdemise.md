In the rural areas of Uttar Pradesh, Sumit’s father was considered to be an opulent, and corrupt businessman who had several connections with the local politicians. He never missed an opportunity to exploit the locals of their naiveness.  

It was time for Sumits father to make yet another tactful move, this time by investing in an old, run-down auditorium that looked blood curdling-ly creepy during the night. It would receive a grand makeover, and only the local VIP’s would be able to gain access to the shows that were hosted here. Several preparations were made for its refurbishment, and as expected everything turned out flawlessly.  

Sumit laid around in his ancestral bungalow feeling neglected and worthless. All his time was consumed by running errands for his father. His mind burned with vengeance.  

The day of the inauguration arrived. Sumit unwillingly joined his father, putting up a smile and hiding his sour emotions, for if not, severe consequences would be met.  

**Post-show**  

Sumits inquisitive mind wasn’t willing to stay put, and he was determined to explore every nook and cranny of this seemingly mysterious place. Something felt out of place, as if it emanated a negative aura, suggesting that everyone leave immediately. The performers hadn’t been seen after the show, and the audience seemed restless, yet ironically, glued to their seats in a hypnotic trance.  

The door to the backstage creaked open, revealing a horrifyingly gruesome sight. The performers were levitating in a possessed manner, and were adorned with worn out clothing reminiscent of monarchical rule in India. Their faces were distressed, and they wailed in disoriented voices that induced terror into Sumit’s befuddled mind. A single voice echoed through Sumit’s mind - GET OUT OF HERE. Just as he was able to register that thought, the door slammed shut and an ear-splitting cry filled the night sky. Not that Sumit’s father thought anything of it...
