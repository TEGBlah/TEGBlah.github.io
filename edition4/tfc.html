                        <br><br>
                        The day started good…… it was a pleasant day in the month of November. I was travelling to my
                        mum’s place for Thanksgiving. Knowing a feast was waiting I was eagerly wanting to reach there
                        without knowing what was afoot. I got of my plane in the Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport
                        and took a car to my parent’s house in the Puerto Rico.
                        <br><br>
                        Before I continue any further let me tell a little bit about my family. I had my mum who lived
                        in a beach house in Puerto Rico and was so loving and caring towards our family, a brother who
                        is the smartest person I have met, my sister-in-law who is basically my own sister and their
                        cute little daughter who was less than a year and had caught our heart with her cuteness, and
                        finally the pillar and the oldest member of my family, my paternal grandmother who is 98 years
                        old who live a few streets away my parent’s house. And of course, how can I forget our dog which
                        my mom had and were always a part of my family.
                        <br><br>
                        So back to the story, I was travelling in car to reach my mum's place. Though the journey from
                        the airport to the house was a long one it was also salubrious journey with palm trees at our
                        eyesight and beautiful shores and blue water at a distance.
                        <br><br>
                        I was travelling from Nevada while my brother’s family was coming from California. We had
                        planned to meet at our parents place the day before thanksgiving that was 24th November. Both of
                        our planes were supposed to arrive at 3 pm but my plane got delayed due to technical issues.
                        Hence, he had got to the house before me.
                        <br><br>
                        After a dreadfully tedious journey I was really happy to finally be home. I got of the car only
                        to see that my brother’s family was waiting in the front lawn. I walked towards them to ask why
                        they were waiting there. I asked and they answered “the door is locked outside and we she has
                        gone out to get groceries. And I think even our cook, nurse and the maid have taken the day off
                        because of thanksgiving. So we were wondering if you would have any spare keys?” and I replied
                        “Sure I have one, will open the door, but instead of waiting you could have asked our neighbor
                        as they always have one”
                        <br><br>
                        I opened the door and to my awful surprise I found my mom dead on the floor. All of us rushed
                        down to the hall, but unfortunately, we were too late. She was dead before we got there.
                        <br><br>
