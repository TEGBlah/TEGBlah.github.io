title: A Fictional Story - My First Music Concert

It was the day, the day in which I had to participate in my first music concert. I could never have imagined singing in front of ten thousand people where I can't afford to make any mistakes. Before leaving, I had gone through multiple checks of my bag to ensure that I hadn't forgotten to pack anything. I remembered to also keep the hot water flask in my bag mainly because of two reasons, it was winter and very cold outside and my throat always got dehydrated very quickly.  

My sister had also suggested me to mix ginger in the hot water to smoothen my throat further. I left home and boarded the bus. The trip took longer than I expected but nevertheless I reached there. The auditorium was big and only helped further increase my nervousness. I went through three to four practice rounds and revised the lyrics several times. My friends too motivated me and suggested that I be calm during the concert and also gave me several tips to overcome my stage fear.  

I was pretty confident now and decided to spectate the performances of others until I was called. Moments later, my name echoed through the auditorium. I took a deep breath, recalled all the tips I was given and took a sip of the "ginger water". I started my performance and everything went smoothly, so much that I had even outperformed my practice rounds. Within seconds, I heard thousands of people clapping and cheering for me and my joy knew no bounds. My friends too praised me.  

Finally all the performances were over and the curtains dropped down. I joyfully returned back home eagerly waiting for the results. Within two weeks, I got an official email from the host of the competition. I was pleasantly surprised at the same time. I saw my name written in big bold letters and a picture of a gold medal next to it.
