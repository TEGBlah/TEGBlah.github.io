*   ### ...Canada's lowest temperature was colder than Mars. This happened on February 3rd, 1947 at Snag Airport 18 miles east of the Alaska-Yukon border. It dropped to the bitter-cold temperature of -81.4°F (-63°C), which is a degree colder than the -80°F (-62.22°C) average temperature of Mars!
*   ### ...Queen Elizabeth II has a body double. You may have not heard of Ella Slack, but you may have seen her. Before the monarch appears at main events, Ella walks, stands, and sits everywhere the Queen will sit and make sure it is perfect. She even dresses like the Queen but due to royal rules, she may only squat over the throne and not sit on it!
*   ### ...You can live without 45% of your body. Theoretically, you can live without one of your lungs, a kidney, your spleen, appendix, gall bladder, adenoids, tonsils, plus some of your lymph nodes, the fibula bones from each leg and six of your ribs. With artificial replacements, you can even go on without your stomach, colon, pancreas, salivary glands, thyroid, and bladder, but life without these parts does sound pretty grim...
*   ### ...Fruit snacks (like gummy bears) made shiny with a wax called carnauba wax, which is used on cars too. So next time, remember this when buying/eating them!
*   ### ...Airplane food tastes different than normal food. This is because the cool, dry air on the plane and the lower oxygen levels in pressurised cabins affect the olfactory receptors you need to taste your food!
*   ### ...The longest name of a place in the world is 85 letters long. Taumatawhakatangi­hangakoauauotamatea­turipukakapikimaunga­horonukupokaiwhen­uakitanatahu is a place in Hawke's Bay, New Zealand and it's English translation is "The summit where Tamatea, the man with the big knees, the slider, climber of mountains, the land-swallower who travelled about, played his kōauau to his loved one"!
*   ### ...More people have been to the Moon in the 20th century than to the Mariana Trench!
*   ### ...The pressure at the deepest part of the ocean is over 8 tons per square inch which is equal to 50 jumbo jets piled on top of you!
*   ### ...A single sneeze can travel at over 100mph and shoots more than 100,000 germs into the air!
*   ### ...Your body is stronger than you thought! Your stomach acid is strong enough to dissolve metal, and your thigh bone (femur) can withstand about 12 tonnes of weight vertically before breaking!
*   ### ...Sperm whales are the loudest animal on Earth at 230 decibels (For comparison, airplanes at takeoff are at about 150 decibels)!
*   ### ...Blue whale hearts weigh over 10 tonnes and beat only once every 10 seconds!
*   ### ...Potatoes are actually native to the Americas. So about 500 years ago people in India, which is one of the largest potato producers currently, did not know what potatoes were!
*   ### ...Cheese is the most shoplifted food in the world!
*   ### ...You cannot actually visit the world's biggest waterfall because it's deep underwater between Iceland and Greenland. The flow of the Denmark Strait cataract is 2,000 times more powerful than Niagara Falls, which is the biggest overland waterfall!
