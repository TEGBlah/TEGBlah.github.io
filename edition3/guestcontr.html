                        This perfectly sums up one of the most riveting and enthralling documentaries of recent times.
                        An indictment of the tech industry, the film succinctly lays out the damage being done by
                        companies such as Facebook, Google and Twitter through their social media platforms and search
                        engines, and what needs to be done to stop it. Director Jeff orlowski manages to get the former
                        employees of these big tech giants to voice their concerns. Even if you have little interest in
                        social media or rarely Google anything, this is a worthwhile peek behind the curtain and helps
                        to explain so much of the craziness that we see in the real world right now. It’s also a little
                        weird to be watching this searing documentary on Netflix considering the fact that they are one
                        of the biggest tech giants in the world.

                        Raju had just moved into Ratna Ka Bas with his mother and father on the outskirts into a
                        decently sized bungalow. His father managed to acquire it for pretty cheap from a widow who
                        needed money for her deceased husband’s funeral. Apparently he died mysteriously without any
                        sign of what caused his untimely demise.
                        <br><br>
                        Raju’s house was near an old fort called Bhangarh Fort. On the 2nd evening of him moving in, he
                        followed a tourist group with a guide who were visiting before closing hours. Once they reached
                        the fort, Raju moved closer to be within earshot of what the guide was saying.
                        <br><br>
                        The guide was a very open and friendly young man who had just passed out of college and was
                        doing tours as a part time job
                        “Welcome to Bhangarh Fort, one of the most beautiful forts you can find in India! It was built
                        by Bhagwant Das for his younger son Madho Singh. It is not without its own haunted past however.
                        Daring people who come here to stay the night have never come back. Once there was a sadhu who
                        cursed the city to death. After that any roof that was built would collapse immediately.”
                        <br><br>
                        Raju was listening with rapt attention. Horror stories would take the attention of any
                        adventurous 8 year old boy.
                        <br><br>
                        “Then there is The Legend of Princess Ratnavati and Singhia Singhia, a black magician, loved
                        Princess Ratnavati and tried to capture her using black magic in a perfume bottle. She was aware
                        of it and threw it at a boulder that rolled down and crushed him. It is said that Singhia’s
                        ghost wanders around the fort. There have been sightings of the ghost even around the outskirts
                        of town, leading to the death of a man in the past month.”
                        <br><br>
                        That was when Raju realized the gravity of the situation. He ran as fast as he could all the way
                        back to his house.
                        <br><br>
                        By the time Raju reached his house, it was night time. He noticed that the door was open and
                        that there were no candles lit inside the house. He entered the dark living room, with nothing
                        burning apart from a sole candle. The poor boy found his mother and father lifeless on the
                        floor, with a look of fear in their eyes.
                        <br><br>
                        “Papa! Mama! Uth Jao!!(Wake up)”
                        He starts uncontrollably crying. His father was scammed into buying this godforsaken bungalow.He
                        turns around to get out of the house but he sees a dark figure in front of the doorway, wearing
                        clothing reminiscent of old monarchical rule in India. Raju tries to scream but no one can hear
                        him.
                        <br><br>
                        The door slams shut and the candle gets blown out by the wind.

                    </h1>

                    <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                        Child labour is one of the social issues which requires the immediate attention of the
                        authorities. Child Labour refers to the working of children and teens to earn a livelihood and
                        support their family.
                        <br><br>
                        As per a report, the world's most destitute and impoverished countries comprise about 25% of
                        children as child Labourers. The leading cause of child Labour in India is the high poverty
                        rate, where children work to earn bread for a day.
                        <br><br>
                        The leading causes of Child Labour in India are social inequality, lack of education, and
                        poverty. According to UNICEF's report, children from the impoverished and rural parts of the
                        world have no available alternatives such as teachers and schools.
                        <br><br>
                        Many rural communities lack adequate school facilities and the availability of schools. The low
                        paying economy blooms with low cost, easy to hire, and Child Labour. Besides the unorganized
                        Agricultural sector, child Labour exists in unorganized assembly, unorganized retail works, and
                        unorganized trade sectors.
                        <br><br>
                        Other factors of child Labour include the informal economy's size, the inability of most Indian
                        industries to scale up, lack of modern technologies, and the structure and inflexibility of the
                        Indian market.
                        <br><br>
                        Children are employed due to social obligation, or loans and debts made by the families.
                        Usually, children are forced to employ their families in brick kilns, stone and quarries, and
                        agricultural sectors.
                        <br><br>
                        The children of the migrant workers and those that belong to the marginalized sections and in the society are made to work in small production houses and factories in the urban
                        areas. Child Labourers on the bond are usually subjected to physical and mental abuse.
