You are the creative force behind your life. it all starts with you and ends with you! you need to understand who you are , how you are, what you want to be and where you want to be. For this you need to identify and set your own goals which are specific, measurable, achievable and time bound.These goals can be flexible and can change over time as you evolve as an individual.

To understand this you need to pursue your passions. if your passion becomes your profession then you are a gifted one. To be successful you need to take ownership over things which you can control and accept the things, over which you don't have any control

Measuring Success is a relative term, something that you should compare with yourself and not with others. You should see how you were 10 years back and how you are right now. You might be very talented in a particular field like sports and another person might be great at arts but you can't say that the person who is good at sports is more successful than you, as you cannot compare oranges with apples.

Each person is unique in their own way just like a flower and each person may bloom at different times. Flowers like Hibiscus bloom in the morning where as flowers like Lotus bloom in the night, both are unique and attractive but just bloom at different times. Being successful in career does not mean being successful in life. Career is basically your job whereas life includes career, family, friends, social relationships, hobbies and spiritual bliss. People who are average in their career, might be very successful in life.

To explain in simple words the whole movie is your life but a scene is your career.
