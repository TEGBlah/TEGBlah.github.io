## Age
### by Arshitha

What is age?<br>
It rises but never sets.<br>
A unique factor,<br>
with different perspectives.

Oh! Age can’t you stop,<br>
Suppressing your own revolt?<br>
Having a distinctive nature,<br>
Let people embrace, a longer period.

What have you got?<br>
What is strength do you have?<br>
Aren’t you great?<br>
Then give yourself a pause.
<br><br>

## Pillar of Family 
### by Arnav

Of every family in the world,<br>
There’s a man to bear every burden.<br>
Taking care of every issue and affair,<br>
He is titled, “The Father.”

Mothers give a life,<br>
Fathers give a living.<br>
Everything that you have,<br>
Supplied by one man.

He strives for your good,<br>
He pays for your likes.<br>
He warns you about the bad,<br>
He protects you from the worst.

He pours his life for yours,<br>
For a reason, he is titled “The Father.”
