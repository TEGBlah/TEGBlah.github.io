A banknote is a type of negotiable instrument known as a promissory note, made by a bank, payable to the bearer on demand. When banknotes were first introduced, they were, in fact, a promise to pay the bearer in coins, but gradually became a substitute for the coins and a form of money in their own right. Here is of a really nice looking banknote.

This the is 1 Rial, from Oman. It shows Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al Said on the observe. The one Rial shows a ship, a tower and an Omani coin. 1 Omani Rial is a whopping 192 Rupees in India! The one Rial banknote is a pink in color, while the other banknotes are in various colors like purple and green.

The Qatari Riyal is a slightly plain banknote featuring the coat of arms of Qatar on the observe and native birds on the reverse. The main color for the 1 Qatari Riyal is gray and blue. One Qatari Riyal is 20 rupees in India.

Now for this I am going to take the most interesting one of these banknotes which the the 100,000 Indonesian Rupiah banknote. It sounds ridiculous but it is true! As crazy as it may sound it is a really good looking banknote so letâ€™s see it in some detail.  

The observe features Sukarno and Mohamad Hatta. Sukarno was the first president and the person who helped Indonesia during the Dutch invasion. Mohamad Hatta was the first vice president. The reverse features the topeng dance that is a respect to ancestors in Indonesian culture. One Indonesian Rupiah is 5 thousandth of an Indian Rupee! I know, right? Crazy!

The observe features saker falcon and the reverse the Jumeriah Mosque. The main color of this banknote is sky blue but the newer version shows a lighter version of a pink. 1 Emirati is 20.20 Indian Rupees. Indeed very similar to the 1 Qatari Riyal.
