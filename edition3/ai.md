Artificial intelligence and machine learning is the new trend that has transformed our world into a tech bubble. However well something may be, it comes at a cost. So does Artificial Intelligence. Thanks to various big (tech) industries like Google, Microsoft, Amazon etc, we can do anything with just a touch of a button. So is it really taking over our life?

I will take you through some major advantages of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and how we can incorporate it in our daily life. Let us begin with the improvements in electronic gadgets and other electronic applications. Many computers, smartphones and other gadget making companies are breaking their back to develop next-generation tech innovations in the field of designing chips, graphic cards and processors to make sure that the customers have the smoothest experience whether it will be just surfing the web, watching random YouTube videos or using it for professional use.

Speaking of web, browsers have taken a dive through some serious development right from auto-complete, website suggestions, purchase suggestions and many other useful updates. Many e-Commerce websites have also seen a drastic improvement with even fresh vegetables and fruits delivered right to our doorstep.

In these COVID times, contact-less online payments have become far more popular than ever before. Just enter the amount, an high security password and with the click of a button its done. Many vehicle making companies have also put in a lot of effort into developing electronic re-chargeable cars which not only help reduce air pollution from the amount of fuel and smoke emitted but also served as an inspiration for other companies to develop "eco-friendly" innovations in the field of technology.

So has it helped us? Definitely! but it has also made us significantly more lazier to do manual work...
