                        Now, you would be wondering what this title means? Let me narrate the marvellous incident which
                        took place the previous night.
                        <br><br>
                        I had just hit the bed last night when a black hole just appeared out of nowhere. (The ones that
                        swallow the universe). My whole body shuddered with fright. “Was I going to die?”, I asked
                        myself with fear.
                        <br><br>
                        Then, suddenly a hand dragged me and for the next few minutes, my head was swirling in and out.
                        I fell on the ground unconscious. I was puzzled when I woke up! What could've happened? The next
                        thing I saw came out of the blue, I saw myself in front of me (not in a mirror). She looked
                        taller, older and had longer hair. I took a double-take but still saw myself.
                        “Was I in some kind of illusion?”, I asked myself, “Or had I gone insane?”
                        There was a scent which smelled really bad. First I stood motionless and then fainted.
                        The next time I woke up I was in a mansion.
                        <br><br>
                        “Hello, Hello”, I shouted waiting for someone to reply, but all I heard was my own echoing
                        voice.
                        My stomach started having butterflies in it. Then, I went in, to search for food and also to
                        check if anyone lived here. There was no food in any of the pantries. The mansion also seemed to
                        be deserted. I heard some peculiar ghost sounds. Personally, I thought the mansion was haunted
                        (the curtains were torn and the floor had humongous footprints in them). I escorted myself out.
                        As I was walking, I saw my possibly older self again and I wanted to run to her and ask her if
                        she was the one who brought me here. A dog stood next to her. Suddenly, it started barking
                        vigorously. Seriously dogs! I was terrified of those creatures (Even though the puppies were
                        cute).
                        <br><br>
                        “Run, Run, Run!”, I told myself.
                        There was a palm tree, I hid behind it. Watching them drift off, I sighed ( So close but so
                        far). Instantly, I fell inside a hole that opened up beneath the tree. It kept on going and
                        going.
                        <br><br>
                        “Was the pipe connected to the core?”, I asked confusingly.
                        I landed exactly a minute later. It consisted of another world. Here, people did everything
                        differently moreover oppositely. They were all having their houses upside down (probably a
                        century later it was fine, but as I glimpsed at it now it looked strange). Everyone there flew
                        on birds or some had artificial wings.
                        <br><br>
                        Someone‘s wing started malfunctioning and he came storming towards the ground and hit me hard.
                        What would you say if I said that I went unconscious again?
