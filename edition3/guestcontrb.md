Surrounding Tech<br>
By Aneerudh - 8D<br>
<h2>═══════</h2>

I wake up each morning,<br>
When my android makes noise. <br> 
Technically speaking,  <br>
He’s just one of my toys. <br> <br>

I won’t wait for weeks,<br>  
I demand it today.  <br>
Another PS5 game,  <br>
I can’t wait to play.  <br><br>

I drive half a block,  <br>
To reach my school.  <br>
Technology is friendly;  <br>
With a SmartBoard  <br><br>

I return to my Home,  <br>
My game has arrived.  <br>
My Parents are right,  <br>
Technology deprived.<br><br>

If you are not paying for the product, then you are the product<br>

This perfectly sums up one of the most riveting and enthralling documentaries of recent times. An indictment of the tech industry, the film succinctly lays out the damage being done by companies such as Facebook, Google and Twitter through their social media platforms and search engines, and what needs to be done to stop it. Director Jeff orlowski manages to get the former employees of these big tech giants to voice their concerns. Even if you have little interest in social media or rarely Google anything, this is a worthwhile peek behind the curtain and helps to explain so much of the craziness that we see in the real world right now. It’s also a little weird to be watching this searing documentary on Netflix considering the fact that they are one of the biggest tech giants in the world.

The Curse of Black Magic<br>
by Dhruv - 11B
<h2>═══════</h2>
</div>

Raju had just moved into Ratna Ka Bas with his mother and father on the outskirts into a decently sized bungalow. His father managed to acquire it for pretty cheap from a widow who needed money for her deceased husband’s funeral. Apparently he died mysteriously without any sign of what caused his untimely demise.  

Raju’s house was near an old fort called Bhangarh Fort. On the 2nd evening of him moving in, he followed a tourist group with a guide who were visiting before closing hours. Once they reached the fort, Raju moved closer to be within earshot of what the guide was saying.  

The guide was a very open and friendly young man who had just passed out of college and was doing tours as a part time job “Welcome to Bhangarh Fort, one of the most beautiful forts you can find in India! It was built by Bhagwant Das for his younger son Madho Singh. It is not without its own haunted past however. Daring people who come here to stay the night have never come back. Once there was a sadhu who cursed the city to death. After that any roof that was built would collapse immediately.”  

Raju was listening with rapt attention. Horror stories would take the attention of any adventurous 8 year old boy.  

“Then there is The Legend of Princess Ratnavati and Singhia Singhia, a black magician, loved Princess Ratnavati and tried to capture her using black magic in a perfume bottle. She was aware of it and threw it at a boulder that rolled down and crushed him. It is said that Singhia’s ghost wanders around the fort. There have been sightings of the ghost even around the outskirts of town, leading to the death of a man in the past month.”  

That was when Raju realized the gravity of the situation. He ran as fast as he could all the way back to his house.  

By the time Raju reached his house, it was night time. He noticed that the door was open and that there were no candles lit inside the house. He entered the dark living room, with nothing burning apart from a sole candle. The poor boy found his mother and father lifeless on the floor, with a look of fear in their eyes.  

“Papa! Mama! Uth Jao!!(Wake up)” He starts uncontrollably crying. His father was scammed into buying this godforsaken bungalow.He turns around to get out of the house but he sees a dark figure in front of the doorway, wearing clothing reminiscent of old monarchical rule in India. Raju tries to scream but no one can hear him.  

The door slams shut and the candle gets blown out by the wind.

A Short Article on Child Labour
by Pradheiksha - 8D
<h2>═══════</h2>
</div>

Child labour is one of the social issues which requires the immediate attention of the authorities. Child Labour refers to the working of children and teens to earn a livelihood and support their family.  

As per a report, the world's most destitute and impoverished countries comprise about 25% of children as child Labourers. The leading cause of child Labour in India is the high poverty rate, where children work to earn bread for a day.  

The leading causes of Child Labour in India are social inequality, lack of education, and poverty. According to UNICEF's report, children from the impoverished and rural parts of the world have no available alternatives such as teachers and schools.  

Many rural communities lack adequate school facilities and the availability of schools. The low paying economy blooms with low cost, easy to hire, and Child Labour. Besides the unorganized Agricultural sector, child Labour exists in unorganized assembly, unorganized retail works, and unorganized trade sectors.  

Other factors of child Labour include the informal economy's size, the inability of most Indian industries to scale up, lack of modern technologies, and the structure and inflexibility of the Indian market.  

Children are employed due to social obligation, or loans and debts made by the families. Usually, children are forced to employ their families in brick kilns, stone and quarries, and agricultural sectors.  

The children of the migrant workers and those that belong to the marginalized sections and in the society are made to work in small production houses and factories in the urban areas. Child Labourers on the bond are usually subjected to physical and mental abuse.
