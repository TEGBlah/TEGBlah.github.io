        The Blah was founded in 4th Grade by Shambhavi (who left the school in 6th) and Aayush. There were 3
        editions totally and they were stuck outside the 4/5C classroom or everyone to see. It was a big hit among
        the students.
        <br><br>
        It was refounded by Arnav in the summer holidays of 2021 and consisted most of the original members with
        some new additions.
