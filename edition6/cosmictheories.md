<h2 style="text-align: center;">What is a Neutron Star?</h2>

A Neutron star, essentially, is the collapsed core of a supergiant star, if the star was metal-rich in its core (One solar mass = 2x1030 kgs. That is huge!!). They are formed by the supernova or the explosive death of these supergiant stars, combined with gravitational collapse, which compresses it past the density for the formation of a white dwarf. Neutron stars are the smallest and densest class of stellar objects currently known. Neutron stars have a radius of only 10 kilometers, and a mass of about only 1.4 solar masses, which is very small for a star. What’s amazing about them is that once they are completely formed, they do not generate heat at all. In fact, they begin to cool down over time! They still may evolve through collision, though. Neutron stars get their name from what they are. Scientists imply that they are composed entirely of neutrons (subatomic particles with no net charge and are slightly more in mass compared to protons). Electrons and Protons collide & combine to form neutrons in a neutron star. 

Some notable facts about these stars are that: These Neutron stars have a high surface temperature (599726.85°C) and they are so dense that a regular matchbox containing the material of a neutron star would weigh 3 billion tonnes!  The gravitational field at a neutron star’s surface alone is 200 billion times that of Earth’s gravitational field!

The multiverse is a theory we all are familiar with. It is a hypothetical group of multiple universes. Together, these universes comprise everything that exists. The entirety of matter, energy, space, time, physical laws and the constants that describe them. The different universes are called parallel universes, or alternate universes. Early recorded examples of the idea of infinite worlds existed in the philosophy of Ancient Greek Atomism. It stated that infinite parallel worlds arose from the collision of atoms. In the third century BCE, the philosopher Chrysippus suggested that the world eternally expired and regenerated, suggesting the existence of multiple universes across time.

The concept of multiple universes became more defined in the Middle Ages. In Dublin in 1952, Erwin SchrÃ¶dinger, a famous physicist, gave a lecture in which he warned his audience that what he was about to say might seem lunatic. He said that when his equations seemed to describe several different histories, these were not alternatives, but happened simultaneously. This sort of duality is called superposition.
