## The Rain Outside
### by Arnav


Oh, how the world around us,<br>
Changes in a second.<br>
Then, to see the rain outside,<br>
The entire family, we then beckon.

Oh, the beautiful smell of damp, wet sand.<br>
Oh, the drops of water you catch in your hand.<br>
The kids shout, “Can we go out in the rain and play?”<br>
Mother says, “Sure, but do not overstay!”

For several minutes, or hours, we do not know.<br>
The wind sways the rain, to and fro.<br>
Plants and crops, everywhere they grow.<br>
People pray to the water-gods, then lo!


## The creek down the hill
### by Arnav

Every time I go out for a walk,<br>
I see the little creek,<br>
Running down the hill,<br>
Flowing into the park.

It gushes past the plants,<br>
Swerves around the pebbles<br>
And when the giant rock set foot on the hill,<br>
The creek moved around, being ever so gentle.

It seems to be relentless,<br>
Flowing around every obstacle.<br>
People think its just water,<br>
But I think its a spectacle.

Every time I go out for a walk,<br>
Every time I see a resting croc,<br>
I see the little creek,<br>
Running down the hill,<br>
Flowing into the park.
