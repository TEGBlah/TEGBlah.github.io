It had been 10 years since Samir’s parents had disappeared. “Nana, now that I’ve turned 18 years old, am I allowed to travel by myself?”, he asked... determined to hear the answer he needed. “Well, I suppose so.”, said Nana in a rather dull tone. “Alright in that case, I would like to take my first trip abroad by myself!”, he said with an enthusiastic voice. “Samir, it’s too dangerous travelling overseas alone. you can’t go by yourself.” She exclaimed. “Nana, I’m all grown up now. I’ve been waiting for this for the past 10 years, please. I’ve done all the research and I’ve read the precautions to take. And see- I also have some equipment that could help me if I get stuck somewhere or my plane crashes- not that it is going to- please Nana...?”, he sighed.

“Well alright, alright.. but be safe, I can't let anything happen to you too.” She sighed heavily. “Thank you, nana! This means a lot”, he hugged nana and ran up the stairs. “Well… let’s see… 5000 rupees for a ticket to the Bahamas. That’s lesser than I expected!”, he ran to the other side of his room and took out a large glass jar from under his bed. Samir opened the jar and poured out all the coins and notes that were inside. “5000, 6000, 7000” he mumbled to himself.

He ran back and looked at the price of the ticket once again. This was the moment he had been waiting for. As a child, he was very curious about the smallest things. Ever since the incident, he started saving up and decided to go and find his parents when he was old enough. All the days of research, exploring and studying was finally going to pay off. He clicked on the “buy” icon on the laptop and did not regret buying the ticket one bit. “There's no time to waste!!” Samir exclaimed with joy.

He stuffed a couple of clothes, some of his books, and his special equipment in a backpack that was waterproof. He seemed to be prepared for almost everything. “Nana, tomorrow morning the flight leaves at noon!” he said as he skipped down the stairs. “Oh, that’s wonderful dear!” she exclaimed as she gave him a hug. “Now I suppose you’ve already finished packing?” “Yes! Of course! Nana, if it’s alright, can I take a box of your homemade pakoras with me please?” Samir asked nana. “Oh, why not?! A little something to remind you of home” she smiled. “Thanks nana, for everything”. “Oh, come here” she said as she teared up. “Well now hurry up, get some sleep! There’s a tiring day ahead of you!” Nana said as she wiped the tears off her face and laughed. Samir smiled and went up to his room. He lay on his bed and stared out of the window. The same thing he did 10 years ago, and asked the question he asked so long ago, the question that drove him,  except this time he knew the answer to his question….
