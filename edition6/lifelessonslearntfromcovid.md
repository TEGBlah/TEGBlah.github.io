While the pandemic may seem like a disastrous nightmare that shook the world, killing millions of people, in these dark times we learnt some valuable life lessons as well.

For instance, we learnt how difficult it was to be reserved from social interaction when we were advised to stay in our homes during the lockdown.

**Technological innovations** - One of the major industries that grew during this outbreak was the technology and communication industry. Almost 90% of the world has become dependent on online video calls, classes and work from home utilizing video communication softwares and applications.

Many tech newbies have had to keep up with advanced technology even if it wasnâ€™t within their comfort zones. While this might have proven to be a tremendous task, it also taught us the importance of technology. This has truly proved to be the start of a new era filled with technology.

**A change in the aspect of Education** - Another important factor of life that has benefited out of this pandemic is education. Teachers and instructors of various schools and colleges made use of PowerPoints and other utilities to provide an effective and easy way of teaching advanced core concepts that the students had trouble learning otherwise.

**Modernisation of health care industries** - The health care workers were also constantly working trying to provide efficient health care services to the people affected by the virus and others. Medical infrastructures expanded and paved new and improved ways of medication. Scientists spent months researching vaccines to cure this virus and found two. The governments also provided medical funds to those who were affected and ensured that most got cured.

**A change in people's aspect of hygiene** - This pandemic was also a wake up call for us as also learnt the importance of maintaining good health and hygienic practices and employed several preventive measures such as social distancing to stagnate the spread of the disease.

**Importance of social interactions** - The final and the most important thing that we learnt from this pandemic is how important social interactions are. Social interactions are instrumental in our lives as they are  the only way to get a firm foothold in the community. Communication can help achieve almost anything in life, be it friends or team leadership. We were forced to stay imprisoned in our homes with no hope of active communication during lockdown. Though online video calls did do the job, they failed to express and convey our entire thought process clearly. 

Let us all hope that we soon return back to our original lifestyles and enjoy our life as we did before! This pandemic has taught us not only the value of time but also the importance of people's lives. Together, let's traverse the situation in a positive direction and regain our once lost happiness. Let us pray that we breathe fresh air soon!
