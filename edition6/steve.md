*A fictional story inspired by Minecraft*

“Where-”
My mind was a hollow dome. The seemingly ominous atmosphere gripped my throat, and it felt like someone was playing ping-pong inside my head. I contorted my neck in pain, trying to process my surroundings. Questions reverberated through my mind. “What, where, how”. 

Who even was I..?

I tried to stagger onto my feet to no avail, my entire body slumped to the ground from exertion. At least I understood something; I was weak, frail and vulnerable.
Time passed, and the Sun rose to its peak, prodding into my groggy eyes. I groaned in fatigue. I could feel my hunger being nibbled away by the surroundings, which at that time was hostile to me. I was completely oblivious to my atmosphere and had no idea of who I was or why I was here, though ironically, it seemed as if I subconsciously knew exactly what to do. 

Just as I was engulfed with nausea, bearing the burden of infinite thoughts, I snapped into place. Something seemed to have changed. It seemed as if I finally had control over my body and, reassured by that, I summoned all the energy that my dwindling self beheld and staggered to my feet. 

It took me a while to absorb everything. The rolling landscape was strewn with vivid and intricate flowers. The trees towered meters above my frail and muddled physique; imposing, yet gentle. Everything about this world.. Or what I had seen of it till now, was enchanting and lively, yet mystical and surreal. It emanated a very queer aura. Something that wasn’t of this dimension. I was allured by this unexplored place, and by the looks of it, everything around me seemed pristine and unscathed; though ominously, it seemed like it was at the mercy of an inexplicable external force. 

How long was I absorbed in these thoughts? The Sun was already sinking beneath the horizon. The trees shimmered in the glorious radiation of the Sun. But apart from all the breathtaking scenery, what was I supposed to do? I strongly knew and believed that I had a purpose here, and that I knew exactly what to do. 

I swiftly got up, not wanting to squander away the little time I had. My instincts pointed me towards a tree. I rigorously shook it, unexpectant of anything,  though I’d forgotten that this was a completely different dimension. Anything and everything could be possible, and that’s exactly why I was able to uproot the entire tree, and  break it down into smaller chunks. I was appalled, but I was also petrified by the power that I was graced with.What else could I accomplish with this immense strength? What if every being in this dimension was capable of more than they could imagine?! 

I was cast into deep thought, once again pondering over my initial, futile questions. 

Meanwhile, darkness prevailed and the afternoon’s conditions were completely reversed. The bleak weather crawled up my throat and the sombre skies made me feel insignificant and helpless, at the mercy of nature and the creatures that were to descend upon me. And yes, I was right. There were indeed ghastly creatures that roamed these lands, during the void that is dusk. 

A grotesque figure advanced towards me with horrifying delight. It grunted softly… softly enough to not catch my attention. 

It was a macabre sight and I need not delve into the grisly details. The zombie didn’t spare a single hunk of flesh. And within seconds, all that remained were the meagre pieces of wood, and bones, though that was not my fate. It was destined to be greater.

I steadily came back into place. The exact same person, with the exact same energy and with memory of the happenings before the death. This was the exact same place that I’d experienced immeasurable agony, and the same place that I was thrown into.
It all came together, as I processed the happenings…

I was...invincible?
