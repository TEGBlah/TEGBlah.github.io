2020, the year during which India was expected to become a superpower, instead, the economy took a plunge, and the CAA protests took place. Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam predicted in his book, India 2020: A vision for the new millennium, that India would become a superpower. But it hasn’t; the unemployment rates have gotten worse. But, all India needs is some time and some effort input by the government. “Made in India” can be promoted, and India must rely mainly on itself. We need to make it appealing for foreign brands to set up factories and invest in the economy. 

Covid has delayed the date, but India will be on it’s way to become a superpower if India pushes it’s modernization. Sure, the situation right now isn’t the best, many people still live in poverty and are malnourished, the economy has had big setbacks due to covid. The focus should be taken away from religious matters in India, and the government should not focus on unimportant matters. The military can be strengthened and freedom of speech should be encouraged further, and people should get a say in what the government carries out. If the government and the people work together to this goal, we could see India as a global superpower in the next few decades.
