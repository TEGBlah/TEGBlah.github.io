2020, the year during which India was expected to become a superpower, instead, the economy got worse, and the CAA protests happened. Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam predicted in his book, India 2020: A vision for the new millennium, that India would become a superpower. But it hasn’t, the unemployment rates have gotten worse. But, all India needs is some time and some effort put in by the government. “Made in India” should be promoted, and India should rely mainly on itself, not on other nations like Germany, Russia, France etc. India needs to make it appealing for foreign brands to set up factories and invest in the economy. 

Covid has delayed the date, but India will be on it’s way to become a superpower if India pushes it’s modernization. Sure, the situation right now isn’t the best, many people still live in poverty and are malnourished, the economy has had big setbacks due to covid. The focus should be taken away from religious matters in India, and the government should not focus on unimportant things. The military must be strengthened and there should be more freedom of speech, and people should get a say in what the government does, especially laws like the CAA and the 2020 farming laws. If the government and the people work together to this goal, we could see India as a global superpower in the next few decades.
