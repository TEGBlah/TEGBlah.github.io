Aayush is an integral part of the Blah team and plays a key role guaranteeing the completion of things. He laid the first foundations of the Blah and has good leadership qualities which make him the perfect leader for the Blah team. He is an aspiring fiction writer and serves as a great inspiration to many others. He spends his free time solving Rubik's cubes and has deep passion for the same. He found an interest for Rubik's cubes in May 2018 and promptly learned to solve the 3x3 and 2x2 in less than a month, mainly due to his vast interest for the hobby. In due time, he participated in his first cubing competition (SRM Cube Open 2018) in which was able to solve the 3x3 in about 40 seconds which was an amazing time for an amateur cuber. He came back more prepared in the SSN Cube Open 2018 and broke his previous time by 50% solving the 3x3 in 17 seconds and the 2x2 in 6 seconds. His current average of five in the 3x3 cube is 8 seconds and 4 seconds in 2x2. He has a burning passion for cubing and soon hopes to break the national record of his country.

**1. What was the initial spark that fuelled your motivation to invest your time into learning a completely new hobby, what drew you towards it over others**<br>

Though solving Rubik's cubes as fast as possible sounds immensely mundane and absurd, those thoughts are superficial, and if you take a closer look at this intricate hobby, its much more than what meets to the eyes. 

Surfing the depths of YouTube and various other platforms in the internet really gave me an insight into cubing, and was instrumental in sparking my passion for it. Rubik's cubes are more than just a plastic toy, there's an entire community dedicated to mastering the art of solving it as fast as possible, and it personally gave me the motivation to achieve something significant in this field.

**2. Can you recall the experience in the first ever cubing competition that you attended? Elaborate your experience of being one among the several hundred participants. How did you succeed in overcoming the nervousness?**<br>

I wasn't really expecting much out of my first competition to be frank, but it was an unforgettable experience to say the least. More than trying to progress to the further rounds, this competition really stood out as an opportunity for me to interact and socialise with others who shared the exact same hobby as mine. Since it was my first competition and I was one amongst the one hundred and fifty odd participants and I was relatively new to cubing, my expectations weren't through the roof and I was able to secure an average which I was satisfied with.
<br><br>
**3. What inspired you to continue cubing over the years? What do you feel about cubing yourself? Do you take it more as a hobby or a career?**<br>

Cubing was something that I indulged in out of personal fascination and passion. It was never something that I was obligated to do, and I was comforted by the fact that I could take a break if I was saturated and not face any concequences.
<br><br>
**4. Do you have any specific goals as a cuber? Is there any specific method you took towards improving your times?**<br>

Cubing undoubtedly requires immense dedication and skill, but unfortunately, cubing doesn't support a full time career as of now. This is mostly due to its lack of popularity and recognition in comparison to other fields and games which leads to scarcity in sponsors and investors that percieve cubing as a profitable investment.
<br><br>
**5. Were there any special moments during your cubing journey which gave you immense pleasure? Were there any moments which made a change in the path of your cubing career?**<br>

Right now my sole focus is dedicated towards being one amongst the leading cubers in India, and achieve at least one podium in the prestigious Indian Nationals. It's nothing extraordinary, in fact it's something every cuber strives to achieve, but it certainly isn't a cakewalk.
<br><br>
**6. Is there any specific person who inspired you to cube? Do you have any role models in the cubing community?**<br>

My first ever podium will be an everlasting memory ingrained into my mind. It was wild and came out of nowhere, and I shocked myself to the extent of being in a state of disbelief for a while. There weren't any distinct moments that significantly changed the course of my career, but it was moments like these that kept fueling my motivation to continue cubing over the years. To add to that, competing with friends, especially during the lockdown since competitions have been suspended, has ensured that I don't fall out of touch and keep my skills in check.
<br><br>
**7. Is there anyone that motivated you to pursue your cubing journey?**<br>

There have been several people throughout my persistent journey, whether they were friends or the top tier cubers in the community, that have served as an inpiration and benefactor and have been essential in helping me maintain this hobby.
