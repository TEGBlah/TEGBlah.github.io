## Types of IP Addresses

### Consumer Addresses

#### Private IP Address
Your router requires a way to identify devices that connect to the internet from your house. So, all these devices, including bluetooth-enabled ones have a "private IP Address". With the growth of technology, the number of these private IP Addresses at your house are skyrocketing.

#### Public IP Address
The public IP Address is the primary address associated with your entire home network. While each device has its own IP, they are included with the main (public) address of your router. Typically ISPs have very large pools of IP Addresses that they distribute to their customers. All devices outside your network use this to identify it.

### Types of Public IP Addresses

#### Dynamic
Dynamic Addresses change automatically, and regularly. ISPs buy large pools of IP addresses and assign them automatically to the users. Periodically, they then re-assign them and return the older ip addresses back in the pool to be re-used with other users. This is for security and cost benefits, as it makes it harder for criminals to hack you, and they do not have to carry out specific actions if the customer moves physically.

#### Static
Static addresses, in contrast to dynamic addresses remain the same. Once the network gets assigned an address, it is permanent. It is crucial for businesses which plan to host their own server and for websites and email addresses, which require ip addresses tied to it.
